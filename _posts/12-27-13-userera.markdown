#The ~User Era
The **~User Era** is a name coined for the time period encompassing the late June update to the site’s URL system. The most important feature would be the username of a world's owner being visible. This period in YWOT history began July 8th, 2013 and continues to the present day.

The update was taken controversially, with opponents stating it would cause YWOT to be too complicated. Andrew however pushed for the update to be released, regardless. The official release date was on July 8th, 2013, the start of this time period.

InfraRaven, though an opponent of this update, created ~index, which would be the predecessor to /Comprehensive, YWOt’s biggest world cataloguing project.

Later on, the distribution of scripts led to lag and confusion on the frontpage, ending in a long fought stalemate between the script leaker and opposers.

####Important Events Include
