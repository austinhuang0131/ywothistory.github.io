On July 8th 2013, the YWOT URL system was changed in an update, among many things. During this era, YWOT was updated, spam continued to be a problem, and scripts were leaked by a user of the name Lol007.

###For Better or worse

This update, unlike previous updates, featured a change to YWOT's URL naming system. All worlds would now have the names of their creators visible.

The update was taken controversially, with opponents stating it would cause YWOT to be too complicated. Andrew however pushed for the update to be released, regardless. The official release date was on July 8th, 2013. Development was assisted by "Employee of the Month", Colibri.

InfraRaven, though an opponent of this update, created ~index, which would be the predecessor to /Comprehensive, YWOTâ€™s biggest world cataloguing project.

###Spam Still a Problem

Spam was, and continues to be, a major problem for YWOT. Originally the site was intended for conversation which is oftentimes not possible due to spam. Causes include easy access to spamming scripts and an inability to cooperate on the spammer's part.

###Script Leaks

On The 27th of July, 2013, a new user by the name of Lol007 had arrived on YWOT. His intentions were simple: he wanted to spread spam and wreak havoc. Using scripts that he acquired, he managed to spam the YWOT frontpage. He then created many of his own pages allowing for leaking of less powerful but still harmful scripts.

However it is true that many YWOT members, even helpful, spam YWOT from time to time. As sammich put it, "We all have a little lol007 in us".

The elite YWOT community, in particular users like InfraRaven and colibri, were outraged. Poopman created a page called [/fuck007](http://yourworldoftext.com/fuck007) which expressed anger. For a long time after the spamming occured, spam was always blamed on Lol007, whether he was the cause or not.

Many soon compared Lol007 to Hitler. In fact, someone even made a page [/~Hitler](http://yourworldoftext.com/~hitler). He was also called "lol" or "L7".

InfraRaven organized a DDoS attack on Lol007's page [/~Lol007](http://yourworldoftext.com/~Lol007), and spammed his other pages like /~YWOT_scripts and /~YWOTscriptrequest. Bitter tensions held for months. Below is an image of the DDos attack.

After many long months, tensions finally eased. Regardless, the damage had already been done. Many pages "locked up" to prevent spam, and all of Lol007's pages had been spammed. He became a well hated figure on YWOT, and impacts were huge.

####The Lol007 Paranoia of late 2013

Lol007 had become such a prevalent name that almost all new users to the YWOT community were presumed to be and alternate account of his or an account for spamming. This resulted in the cold shouldering of many new users, regardless of what they had to offer.

###~index is Updated

Index, formerly /comprehensive, for a long amount of time had difficulty adapting to the new URL system. Finally, as a means of simplifying things, Randomguy_ enacted the sorting by username the page needed. In addition the page's layout was also simplified and cleaned. This update was referred to as "Index 2.0"

Afterwards ~index was updated multiple times. Finally a cleaner design was settled upon.

And again...

###Randomguy_'s Departure

On the 19th of August 2014, roughly two years after joining, Randomguy_ announced his YWOT departure. Because he is the main writer of this history page, it is unsure if there will be any history below this section though if there is that's good. He announced his departure first on [https://this.spooks.me](https://this.spooks.me), a chatting site developed by InfraRaven. He still browses Spooks chat.
