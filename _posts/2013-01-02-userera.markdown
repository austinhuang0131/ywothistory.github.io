`An example of how YWOT users took advantage of the update`

On July 8th 2013, the YWOT URL system was changed in an update, among many things. During this era, YWOT was updated, spam continued to be a problem, and scripts were leaked by a user of the name Lol007.

###For Better or worse

This update, unlike previous updates, featured a change to YWOT's URL naming system. All worlds would now have the names of their creators visible.

The update was taken controversially, with opponents stating it would cause YWOT to be too complicated. Andrew however pushed for the update to be released, regardless. The official release date was on July 8th, 2013. Development was assisted by "Employee of the Month", Colibri.

InfraRaven, though an opponent of this update, created ~index, which would be the predecessor to /Comprehensive, YWOTâ€™s biggest world cataloguing project.

###Spam Still a Problem

Spam was, and continues to be, a major problem for YWOT. Originally the site was intended for conversation which is oftentimes not possible due to spam. Causes include easy access to spamming scripts and an inability to cooperate on the spammer's part.

###Script Leaks

Later on, the distribution of scripts led to lag and confusion on the frontpage, ending in a long fought stalemate between the script leaker and opposers.

###~index is Updated

Index, formerly /comprehensive, for a long amount of time had difficulty adapting to the new URL system. Finally, as a means of simplifying things, Randomguy_ enacted the sorting by username the page needed. In addition the page's layout was also simplified and cleaned. This update was referred to as "Index 2.0"
