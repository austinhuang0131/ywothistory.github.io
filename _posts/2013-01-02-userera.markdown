On the 8th of July, 2013, an update to YWOT's URL system was launched. Many were opposed to the update, some favored it, and some people tried to inform others about how the update would take hold. Regardless the update was pushed by [Andrew](ywothistory.tk/andrew) and the website changed once again. This is how the site is organized as of current.

###Features of the update

This update, unlike previous updates, featured a change to YWOT's URL naming system. All worlds would now have the names of their creators visible, meaning that there was complete transparency. This also led to confusion due to an absolute fragmenting of world names, as shown below:

The update was taken controversially, with opponents stating it would cause YWOT to be too complicated. Andrew however pushed for the update to be released, regardless. The official release date was on July 8th, 2013, the start of this time period. Development was assisted by [Employee of the Month](youtube.com), Colibri.

InfraRaven, though an opponent of this update, created ~index, which would be the predecessor to /Comprehensive, YWOtâ€™s biggest world cataloguing project.

Frontpage (Before|After)

Later on, the distribution of scripts led to lag and confusion on the frontpage, ending in a long fought stalemate between the script leaker and opposers.

####Important Events Include
- The ~User Update
- The Founding of ~index
- Lol007 Script Leaks
- YWOT Civil War
- The Nov. 2013 Owner-Box Removal
