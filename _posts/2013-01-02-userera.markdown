The event that defined this era was the update of YWOT's [URL](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/U/URL.html) system. While the update occured on July 8th, 2013, the impacts on the YWOT infrastructure were lasting.

##The Update

A change to the URL system was one of the feature of this update. Before, all the owners' names were invisible. If you claimed a world someone else had, or if one was too old, the server would refuse you. Now, with the new world cataloguing method, anyone could claim any world. It was a surefire way of ending the debates between who would claim each world.
In addition to this, the world's /name was visible on each browser tab, and you could directly access a world from the options page because it would be linked. 

The update was not without its downfalls however. Despite the positive change it brought to the YWOT community, it complicated the ability to access worlds. People's confidentiality was also taken away, with the revealed usernames. A large group of people were against this update, probably a majority. One particular outstanding user was InfraRaven, who opposed all change.

The update, as you know, was passed anyways, and it reads on [/~Badr](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~Badr) that "If any of you don't like any of my updates then leave my website!". The changes are here to stay.

##Spamming continues

During this era spam continued to plague YWOT, if not reach a climax.
