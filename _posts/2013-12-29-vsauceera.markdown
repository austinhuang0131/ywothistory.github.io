title: The Vsauce Era (3.29.11 - 8.11.12)
categories: timeline
---

This time period is called the **Vsauce Era**, starting on the date of the Vsauce video's release and ending on August 11th, 2012 when a second DONGS video referencing YWOT was put out. After the video was released, membership took off. The Vsauce video, "10 AMAZING Flash Games - DONG!" gained over 300,000 views during its first three months on YouTube. In addition, the video made "VSAUCE!!!!" a meme on YWOT, which could not be undone! This era lasted from March 29th, 2011 to August 11th, 2012.
