History before the time of the Vsauce Invasion/Explosion is unclear and often ambiguous. YwotHistory staff izo and Randomguy_ have worked extensively to decode the happenings of past YWOT. There are many holes in the early history which are left to the reader to fill in.

###YWOT Beta

Your World Of Text was registered as a domain on August 2nd, 2009.

On August 25th the site was released on Chrome Experiments where it gained popularity and garnered a high ranking.

There is clear evidence that pasting scripts were deployed from the earliest of times, and have become more widespread and destructive as time progressed.

On September 22nd 2009 all beta worlds were moved from [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://beta.yourworldoftext.com) to yourworldoftext.com/beta/.

Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time. Extra features like links and protected tiles were added "at great expense and at the last minute".

###Early YWOT

Many people arrived here from 4chan soon after beta, contributing to the site through javascript.

[Fang](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~mcdowell/fang) was a member of YWOT who made scripts modifying various elements in the site.

The following era yielded an entirely new set of scripts and new ideas produced by the visitors from Vsauce, resulting in many conflicts but also advancements as well.

###The Vsauce Invasion

The Vsauce Era started on the date of the Vsauce video's release when a DONGS video referencing YWOT was put out. After the video was released, membership skyrocketed. The Vsauce video [10 AMAZING Flash Games - DONG!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isEwaLUiLP4) gained over 300,000 views during its first three months on YouTube. In addition, the video made VSAUCE!!!! a YWOT meme.
