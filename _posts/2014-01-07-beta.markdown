Your World Of Text is generally accepted to have been created on August 2nd, 2009 according to a website cataloguing site.

Prior to that however, the starting date was accepted to have been August 4th, 2009, according to [Google Search](http://goo.gl/3q4o9I) results, and research conducted by site member [Randomguy_](http://www.google.com).

Even before it was unknown what the actual starting date was, and it was presumed to have been the end of August.

During this time the website was in its beta era. Beta testing ended around September 22nd 2009 whereupon all beta worlds were moved to "yourworldoftext.com/beta/". The [URL](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url) during the beta era was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://beta.yourworldoftext.com). This now [redirects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection) to the main YWOT homepage.

Few features were available during beta. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time.

Little is left or known of this long gone era. All /beta/ URLs are available at [http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA)
