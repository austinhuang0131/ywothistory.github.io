##The Beta Era

Your World Of Text was registered as a domain on August 2nd, 2009 [(1)](http://rankwe.com/siteinfo/yourworldoftext.com). On August 25th the site was published onto Chrome Experiments [(3)](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/your-world-of-text/?f=).

On September 22nd 2009 all beta worlds were moved to "yourworldoftext.com/beta/". The [URL](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url) during the beta era was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://beta.yourworldoftext.com)[(2)](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~randomguy_/historyofywot).

Few features were available during beta. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time.
