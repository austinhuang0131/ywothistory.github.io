##The Beta Era

Your World Of Text was registered as a domain on August 2nd, 2009. On August 25th the site was published onto Chrome Experiments.

On September 22nd 2009 all beta worlds were moved to "yourworldoftext.com/beta/". The URL during the beta era was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://beta.yourworldoftext.com).

Few features were available during beta. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time.
