Your World Of Text, called YWOT for short, is generally accepted to have started on August 4th, 2009, according to [Google Search](http://goo.gl/3q4o9I) results, and research conducted by site member [Randomguy_](google.com). During this time the website was in its beta era. Beta testing ended around September 22nd 2009 whereupon all beta worlds were moved to "yourworldoftext.com/beta/". The [URL](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url) during the beta era was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://beta.yourworldoftext.com). This now [redirects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection) to the main YWOT homepage.

Few features were available during beta. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time.

Little is left or known of this long gone era. All /beta/ URLs are available at [http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA)
