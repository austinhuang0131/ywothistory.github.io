Your World Of Text was registered as a domain on August 2nd, 2009 <[1](http://rankwe.com/siteinfo/yourworldoftext.com)>. The starting date is marked as August 4th, 2009, according to [Google Search](http://goo.gl/3q4o9I) results.


On September 22nd 2009 whereupon all beta worlds were moved to "yourworldoftext.com/beta/". The [URL](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Url) during the beta era was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://beta.yourworldoftext.com). This now redirects to the main YWOT homepage.

Few features were available during beta. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time.

Little is left or known of this long gone era. All /beta/ URLs are available at [http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA)
