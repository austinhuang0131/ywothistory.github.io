title: YWOT Beta (2009)
categories: timeline
---

YWOT's beta stage was for the most part dominated by a lack of membership and by few of the features that are currently available being present. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time.

This era in YWOT history ran from August 4th, 2009 when YWOT was launched, through September 23th, 2009 when the frontpage was transferred to the new domain. The URL for YWOT during these times was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://www.beta.yourworldoftext.com). A lot of the info from the beta era is saved from the YWOT [feed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yourworldoftext). 

###Life in Beta

Beta was pretty simple for YourWorldOfText. The only availiable ability was page claiming. The full known list of worlds from this time are at ~index's [Beta Page](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA) on YWOT. The users then were ohsin, dmmcintyre3, Danielj, Barber, Ofy1993, Sponge, ninjawars, HotShot, and Dantelia. None of these people are still on the site today as far as it is known.

###URL Naming

All worlds created during the beta era are found in `yourworldoftext.com/beta/[...]` Some are:

- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm)

Though only around 20 beta worlds are now known there may be many more in existence. It's possible a full list could be put together in the future.
