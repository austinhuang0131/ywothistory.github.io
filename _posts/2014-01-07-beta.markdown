**Beta** was the stage of YWOT history when the site was founded by Andrew Badr. YWOT Beta began on *August 4th, 2009*, and ended on *September 23rd, 2009*, when it was superceded by YWOT. Like many other popular websites such as Minecraft or Gmail, YWOT's beta stage was defined by its testing and improvement.

Few features were available during beta. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time. The URL for beta during this time (now redirects to the main site) was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://www.beta.yourworldoftext.com).

`August 4th 2009: The beginning of ywot`
`August 27th 2009: Accounts are now active via [Beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://www.beta.yourworldoftext.com)`
`September 22nd 2009: Homepage is disabled for public writing`

##Life in Beta

Beta was pretty simple for Your World Of Text. The only availiable ability was page claiming. The full known list of worlds from this time are at ~index's [Beta Page](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA) on ywot. The users then were ohsin, dmmcintyre3, Danielj, Barber, Ofy1993, Sponge, ninjawars, HotShot, and Dantelia. None of these people are still on the site today as far as it is known.

###URL Naming

All worlds created during the beta era are found in `yourworldoftext.com/beta/[...]` Some are:

- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm)

Though only around 20 beta worlds are now known there may be many more in existence. It's possible a full list could be put together in the future.
