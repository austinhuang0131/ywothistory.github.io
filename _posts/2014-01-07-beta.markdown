##The Beta Era

Your World Of Text was registered as a domain on August 2nd, 2009. On August 25th the site was published onto Chrome Experiments. During the beta stage YWOT ran on Google's App Engine.

On September 22nd 2009 all beta worlds were moved to "yourworldoftext.com/beta/". The URL during the beta era was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://beta.yourworldoftext.com).

Few features were available during beta. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time.
