title: YWOT Beta (2009)
categories: timeline
---

YWOT's beta stage was for the most part dominated by a lack of membership and by few of the features that are currently available being present. Updates for URL links, Coordinate linking, and adding color to user pages would come at a later time. Beta, in all, was a gray, gray world.

This era in YWOT history ran from August 4th, 2009 when YWOT was launched, through September 23th, 2009 when the frontpage was transferred to the new domain. The URL for YWOT during these 'Gray ages' was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://www.beta.yourworldoftext.com). A lot of the info from the beta era is saved from the YWOT feed on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yourworldoftext). 

###Life in Beta

Beta was pretty simple for YourWorldOfText. The only availiable ability was page claiming. The full known list of worlds from this time are at ~index's [Beta Page](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA) on YWOT. The users then are ohsin, dmmcintyre3, Danielj, Barber, Ofy1993, Sponge, ninjawars, HotShot, and Dantelia. None of whom still are on the site today, unless I am being dumb and some of them are.

###URL Naming

All worlds created during the beta era are found in `yourworldoftext.com/beta/[...]` Take for example

- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm)

Though only around 20 beta worlds are now known there may be many more (I'm currently e-mailing andrew [no i'm not]). It's {possibly} possible a full list could be put together in the future.
