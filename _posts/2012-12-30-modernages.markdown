title: Modern YWOT

This is where the bulk of recorded YWOT history begins, with various conflicts occuring as well as the founding of YWOT pages like /~YwotWiki, /comprehensive, et cetera. This encompasses the whole of YWOT history to the present time.

##Spam Wars

![A blackout on the frontpage (Taken March 16, 2013 - 17:02 CST)](https://raw.github.com/ywothistory/ywothistory.github.io/master/images/the_blackout.jpg)

Soon after the [Vsauce Explosion](http://ywothistory.tk/event/vsauceexplosion), spam on YWOT became a real problem, mostly due to scripts. Due to the fact that scripts were readily available, a "spam mafia" originated on YWOT. Mothereffers was one of these such spamming groups.

Mothereffers was a serious spamming group on YWOT who were quite notorious for their scope of spam. They managed to go under the radar until they were told by user Fenneci that he would report them to the FBI, for harassing a 12 year old. Although such a report was unlikely, and had it happened, unlikely that the FBI would do anything, the threats were taken seriously and the group's leader shut down their page. This is proabably the most serious thing to have happened on YWOT to date.

This era is well remembered for its spam, but also for its art and culture. The influence of the art and culture of YWOT grew, probably the fastest in all its history. A notable monument was the YWOT "Ladder to Heaven", as well as the ascii city located near west of the center area which was in the end destroyed by newcomers to the site.

###Era of Spam
----------
####The First YWOT Lockdown

![An image of the front page during a lockdown](https://raw.github.com/ywothistory/ywothistory.github.io/master/images/ywotlockdown.jpg)

The first lockdown of the frontpage occured on December 21st. Following large quantities of spam Andrew responded by removing nearly all public area on the frontpage, which prompted a largely negative reaction. As the lockdown occured on the rumored date of the Mayan apocalypse it was given the name the [Apocalypse](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/11_12_13)/Rapture. In addition it was giving the name the holiday lockdown because of its occurence near the holidays. The lockdown was ended on the 23rd of December.

####Deathcloud Spams YWOT

Spam on the frontpage was constant by this era on YWOT, and the amount would only increase as time passed. As scripts which produced the spam became more widespread whether through distribution or from creation, spamming groups formed which often spammed ywot pages by request. [Deathcloud](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/deathcloud) was a notable one that then became the target of spam because of the wide range of its attacks.

![The Fail Whale, an icon of the Deathcloud War](https://raw.github.com/ywothistory/ywothistory.github.io/master/images/failwhale.jpg)

Deathcloud launched spamming attacks on various pages, asides from the frontpage. Due to its attack on [Silent Nation Clan](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~sedrys/SilentNationClan), they became an enemy of InfraRaven, who spammed them on the behalf of JA and produced /DeathCloudFails.

####A Silent Kindom

Though organizations became involved in spamming, so did many individuals. Users included Yen, BlackInk, and Whitemouse, who eventually formed alliances, complicating the playing field. YWOT eventually became divided into two sides, people who spammed and then opposers to the spam. It wasn't until late January that the tensions finally eased. Much of the impact of the spam wars became hidden in the background. Spam, however, would continue to impact YWOT for a very long time. Indeed the spam wars were a period of intense scripted warfare.

####Paradise Lost

Spam, during this era, even affected YWOT's most distant and famous monuments. At Y=1000 laid a destination with the given name "Paradise", and at Y=10,000 was Nirvana. Both were destroyed when a large number of 4chan users invaded the site January, putting an end to the cities constructed there.

####A Slight Panic

On the 24th of February, 2013 the owner box usually seen in the spawn point of the front page was removed. The event occured around 8:00 GMT that day, and thereafter YWOT was encapsulated by panic. There was a considerable amount of chaos, confusion, and spamming before things settled down the next day

![Andrew messes with people while the owner box is gone](http://i.imgur.com/8a3r9UM.png)

The owner box would eventually return, though not until the 15th of March. The box would eventually be removed permanently.

###Era of Change
-----------------

####BlackInk Departs YWOT

On February 15th, 2013, BlackInk made a page announcing his departure. His reasons for leaving were that YWOT had become too script ridden and full of hatred. This was quite evident as during the Spam Wars things had gone overboard. On his page he expressed support for a member-only YWOT, stating "It was better that way in my opinion, because it balanced the power of the people who choose to attend".

###Support Grows for A Member-Only YWOT

Following the events leading up to and after the lockdown, JA also expressed his support for a members-only front page. His main page he created was [/MAKEITMEMBER](http://yourworldoftext.com/makeitmember).

Randomguy_ also created a page during this time called [/YwotForProgress](http://yourworldoftext.com/ywotforprogress).

Some could say the campaign caused more harm than good. Ultimately, no changes relating to this were passed and the only way of advertisement used was through spamming or repeatedly posting on the front page.

![Spam showing dislike of Makeitmember](https://raw.github.com/ywothistory/ywothistory.github.io/master/images/makeitmemberspam.jpg)

Additionally, some people believed spam was a part of YWOT and not a problem. Spam had only become a recent problem due to the mass distribution of scripts. And besides, spamming and erasing was part of the fun of being on the site.

###JA Departs YWOT
However, after these events, JA departed on the 22nd of April. To mark his departure, many YWOT worlds changed the colors to their pages, to match the color schemes on JA's page. Shortly thereafter, other members like AtLeastK left the site, leading to a long period of inactivity. Though the results of the spam war was seen as a stalemate, spam would continue to overtake the website, in all its forms. Eventually in the coming months there would be an update of the site's URL system and a move from /Comprehensive to the new world ~index.

The era of spam came to an end after most famous spammers departed the site and the ~user update was rolled out.

##User Era

![Picture of ~Help](https://i.imgur.com/OajHqiJ.png)

On July 8th 2013, the YWOT URL system was changed in an update, among many things. During this era, YWOT was updated, spam continued to be a problem, and scripts were leaked by a user of the name Lol007. In November the center box was removed permanently.

###For Better or worse

This update, unlike previous updates, featured a change to YWOT's URL naming system. All worlds would now have the names of their creators visible.

The update was taken controversially, with opponents stating it would cause YWOT to be too complicated. Andrew however pushed for the update to be released, regardless. The official release date was on July 8th, 2013. Development was assisted by "Employee of the Month", Colibri.

InfraRaven, though an opponent of this update, created ~index, which would be the predecessor to /Comprehensive, YWOTâ€™s biggest world cataloguing project.

###Spam Still a Problem

Spam was, and continues to be, a major problem for YWOT. Originally the site was intended for conversation which is oftentimes not possible due to spam. Causes include easy access to spamming scripts and an inability to cooperate on the spammer's part.

###Script Leaks

On The 27th of July, 2013, a new user by the name of Lol007 had arrived on YWOT. His intentions were simple: he wanted to spread spam and wreak havoc. Using scripts that he acquired, he managed to spam the YWOT frontpage. He then created many of his own pages allowing for leaking of less powerful but still harmful scripts.

The elite YWOT community, in particular users like InfraRaven and colibri, were outraged. Poopman created a page called [/fuck007](http://yourworldoftext.com/fuck007) which expressed anger. For a long time after the spamming occured, spam was always blamed on Lol007, whether he was the cause or not.

Many soon compared Lol007 to Hitler. In fact, someone even made a page [/~Hitler](http://yourworldoftext.com/~hitler). He was also called "lol" or "L7".

![a picture](https://i.imgur.com/g0eeTb4.png)

The YWOT community organized a DDoS attack on Lol007's page [/~Lol007](http://yourworldoftext.com/~Lol007), and spammed his other pages like /~YWOT_scripts and /~YWOTscriptrequest. Bitter tensions held for months. Below is an image of the DDos attack.

![another pic](https://i.imgur.com/7bLIwh3.png)

After many long months, tensions finally eased. Regardless, the damage had already been done. Many pages "locked up" to prevent spam, and all of Lol007's pages had been spammed. He became a well hated figure on YWOT, and impacts were huge.

####The Lol007 Paranoia of late 2013

Lol007 had become such a prevalent name that almost all new users to the YWOT community were presumed to be and alternate account of his or an account for spamming. This resulted in the cold shouldering of many new users, regardless of what they had to offer.

###~index is Updated

Index, formerly /comprehensive, for a long amount of time had difficulty adapting to the new URL system. Finally, as a means of simplifying things, Randomguy_ enacted the sorting by username the page needed. In addition the page's layout was also simplified and cleaned. This update was referred to as "Index 2.0"

![new index](https://raw.github.com/ywothistory/ywothistory.github.io/master/images/newindex.jpg)

Afterwards ~index was updated multiple times. Finally a cleaner design was settled upon.

![another picture of index](https://i.imgur.com/bFOFgcm.png)

And again...

###Randomguy_ Departs

On the 19th of August 2014 two years after joining, Randomguy_ announced his YWOT departure. He announced his departure first on [https://this.spooks.me](https://this.spooks.me), a chatting site developed by InfraRaven which he still browses.

###YWOT settles into a creative deadzone

Activity involving the YWOT community had already been in decline after the YWOT "renaissance" of summer 2012. After the most prominent figures departed YWOT, and others followed, the community went into turmoil. YWOT in coming years would enter an era of darkness, one similar to the early days of the website.

![picture](http://i.gyazo.com/1046be927c934c3348f8387255858f70.png)

The dark ages were to follow.

##The Dark Ages

This image shows spam on the page /spam.

###YWOT dives head first into a vague future

At this point in YWOT's long and winding history, events were piled behind it like dead bodies during the plague. Uncoincidentally, YWOT began to enter a Dark Age.

Many of the greatest achievements of YWOT fell down the drain, including pages such as ~Help, ~YwotWiki, ~index, and many others. The users behind these pages departed, leaving behind a mess of information that could not be fixed. Scripts were the only institution that remained unshaken, but in a twist of fate they were used, and honed, for spamming others.

The website fell into a sort of anarchy, deeper than the one it had already existed in. It was unsure whether the newest members of the community could create a legacy as lasting and powerful as the previous wave of YWOT users.

###~index is again updated

Randomguy_ returned briefly, working to bring the page ~index up to date. Its design was updated for a final time, and /worlds were removed from its roster, dropping the world count from near 2000 to 1300.

![index](http://i.gyazo.com/0ea03ab8ee45ed07ce9d81b8469d917f.png)

###The ~wow99 incident

A user by the name of ~wow99, an alternate alias of Lol007 spammed multiple pages on YWOT. His effects were minimal and quickly brushed off by the community.
