The Apocalypse 2012 Lockdown, also known as the Christmas Lockdown, the Holiday Lockdown,or the "Rapture", began at midnight on December 21st, 2012 GMT and lasted for several days thereafter.

The theme of the lockdown was Mormonism, and such was encouraged if anyone wanted to write in member-space. Done so half-jokingly, few were in fact accepted.

The frontpage was brought back after several days. However the meme of Mormonism continues to be propagated throughout YWOT. A second lockdown came later on in March.
