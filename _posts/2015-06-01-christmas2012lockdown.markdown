The Christmas 2012 Lockdown, a.k.a. the Holiday Lockdown or Apocalypse Lockdown was a transformation of the front page to member-only for a short time, mostly as a means to prevent spam. As can be seen today this was mostly unsuccessful as spam is still commonplace.

The lockdown occured during the 21st of December 2012, though its end date is not known.
