Soon after the [Vsauce Explosion](http://ywothistory.tk/event/vsauceexplosion), spam on YWOT became a real problem. Due to the fact that scripts were readily available, a "spam mafia" originated on YWOT. One of these such spamming groups was Mothereffers.

Mothereffers was a serious spamming group on YWOT. They were quite notorious for their scope of spam. They managed to go under the radar until they were told by user Fenneci that he would report them to the FBI, for harassing a 12 year old. Although such a report was unlikely, and had it happened, unlikely that the FBI would do anything, the threats were taken seriously and the group's leader shut down their page. This is proabably the most serious thing to have happened on YWOT to date.

So indeed Mothereffers was eventually shut down by Andrew. Regardless, the era of spam had begun. Spam became so bad that on some days it was impossible to talk. Blackouts, spamming of unicode black bars en masse, affected the frontpage every couple of days. Erasing was also common. Sometimes people would turn script against script to produce a checkerboard-like pattern (because scripts spammed "by tile")

This era is well remembered for its spam, but also for its art and culture. The influence of the art and culture of YWOT grew, probably the fastest in all its history. A notable monument was the YWOT "Ladder to Heaven", as well as the ascii city located near west of the center area which was in the end destroyed by newcomers to the site.

The era of spam came to an end after most famous spammers departed the site and the ~user update was rolled out.

###Era of Spam
----------

Spam on the frontpage was constant by this era on YWOT, and the amount would only increase as time passed. As scripts became more widespread whether through distribution or from creation, spamming groups formed which often spammed ywot pages by request. [Deathcloud](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/deathcloud) was a notable one that then became the target of spam because of the wide range of its attacks.

####The First YWOT Lockdown

*Main Article: [The Christmas 2012 Lockdown](http://ywothistory.tk/event/christmas2012lockdown.html)*

December 21st marked the first Lockdown of the frontpage. Following large quantities of spam Andrew responded by removing nearly all public area on the frontpage. The reaction was of course largely negative. As the lockdown occured on the rumored date of the Mayan apocalypse it was given the name the [Apocalypse](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/11_12_13)/Rapture. In addition it was giving the name the holiday lockdown because of its occurence near the holidays.

The lockdown was ended on the 23rd of December.

####The Deathcloud War (Jan. 2013)

*Main Article: [The Deathcloud War](http://ywothistory.tk/event/deathcloudwar.html)*

Deathcloud launched spamming attacks on various pages, asides from the frontpage. Due to its attack on [Silent Nation Clan](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~sedrys/SilentNationClan), they became an enemy of InfraRaven, who then sided with JA to produce /DeathCloudFails. The icon was a unicode whale with the word "FAIL" written on it, called the "Fail Whale".

Though organizations became involved in spamming, so did many individuals. Users included Yen, BlackInk, and Whitemouse, who eventually formed alliances, complicating the playing field. YWOT eventually became divided into two sides, people who spammed and then opposers to the spam. It wasn't until late January that the tensions finally eased. Much of the impact of the spam wars became hidden in the background. Spam, however, would continue to impact YWOT for a very long time. Indeed the spam wars were a period of intense scripted warfare.

####A Slight Panic

*Main Article: [The Panic of Feb. 24](http://ywothistory.tk/event/panicoffeb24.html)*

On the 24th of February, 2013 the owner box usually seen in the spawn point of the front page was removed. The event occured around 8:00 GMT that day, and thereafter YWOT was encapsulated by panic. There was a considerable amount of chaos, confusion, and spamming before things settled down the next day

The owner box would eventually return, though not until the 15th of March. The box would eventually be removed permanently.

###Era of Change
-----------------

####BlackInk Departs YWOT

On February 15th, 2013, BlackInk made a page announcing his departure. His reasons for leaving were that YWOT had become too script ridden and full of hatred. This was quite evident as during the Spam Wars things had gone overboard. On his page he expressed support for a member-only YWOT, stating "It was better that way in my opinion, because it balanced the power of the people who choose to attend".

###Support Grows for A Member-Only YWOT

*Main Article: [The Make It Member Campaigns](http://ywothistory.tk/event/makeitmembercampaigns.html)*

Following the events leading up to and after the lockdown, JA also expressed his support for a members-only front page. His main page he created was [/MAKEITMEMBER](http://yourworldoftext.com/makeitmember).

Randomguy_ also created a page during this time called [/YwotForProgress](http://yourworldoftext.com/ywotforprogress). On it he likened Your World Of Text to a society with limited resources. Order was necessary to keep things clean.

Proposals included returning the front page to the Lockdown format and allowing members special privileges.

Some could say the campaign caused more harm than good. Ultimately, no changes relating to this were passed and the only way of advertisement used was through spamming or repeatedly posting on the front page.

Additionally, some people believed spam was a part of YWOT and not a problem. Spam had only become a recent problem due to the mass distribution of scripts. And besides, spamming and erasing was part of the fun of being on the site.

###JA Departs YWOT
After these events, JA departed, on the 22nd of April. To mark his departure, many YWOT worlds changed the colors to their pages, to match the color schemes on JA's page. Shortly thereafter, other members like AtLeastK left the site, leading to a long period of inactivity. Though the results of the spam war was seen as a stalemate, spam would continue to overtake the website, in all its forms. Eventually in the coming months there would be an update of the site's URL system and a move from /Comprehensive to the new world ~index.
