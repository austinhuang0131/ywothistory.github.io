The spam wars began after spam groups formed around the end of the Vsauce era. Lasting from August 11th, 2012 to July 8th 2013, this time period was marked by the attacks of spam groups on the frontpage (in particular Mothereffers), against various ywot pages, and on occasion in wars against other groups.

In addition the influence of the art and culture of ywot grew, probably the fastest in all its history. A notable monument was the ywot "Ladder to Heaven", as well as the ascii city located near west of the center area which was in the end destroyed by newcomers to the site.

Important events include

- The Lockdown of Christmas 2012
- The Deathcould Spammings
- Departure of BlackInk
- Departure of JA
- The No Owner-Box Period
- Make it Member Campaigns
- Formation and Destruction of Paradise/Nirvana
- The January 2013 4chan Influx

###Era of Spam
Spam was constant by this era on ywot, and the amount would only increase as time passed. As scripts became more widespread whether through distribution or from creation, spamming groups formed which often spammed ywot pages by request. [Deathcloud](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/deathcloud) was a notable one that then became the target of spam because of the wide range of its attacks. Though organizations Many individuals joined the skirmishes as well. Users such as Yen, BlackInk, and Whitemouse became involved in the fights. It wasn't until late January that the tension finally eased. Many of the pages were dissolved or erased. Any major impact of the spam wars faded away quickly. Spam, however, would continue to impact ywot for a very long time.

###Era of Change
December 21st marked the first shutdown of the ywot frontpage. Following large quantities of spam Andrew responded by removing nearly all public area on the frontpage. The reaction was of course largely negative. As the lockdown occured on the rumored date of the Mayan apocalypse it was given the name the [Apocalypse](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/11_12_13)/Rapture. In addition it was giving the name the holiday lockdown because of its occurence near the holidays.

The lockdown was ended on the 23rd of December. The member-only periods then and later on March 22nd would provide a base for future movements that acted for support of a member-only frontpage.

###A Member-Only YWOT


Soon after the lockdown, JA, an active member of YWOT and co-founder of Silent Nation Clan, expressed his support for a members-only front page. His main page he created was [/MAKEITMEMBER](http://yourworldoftext.com/makeitmember). BlackInk, a spammer from the spam wars, also expressed his support on his page [/BlackInkDeparture](http://yourworldoftext.com/BlackInkDeparture). A user named Randomguy_ (Created ~YwotWiki) also joined JA's campaign, anonymously in hopes of bettering YWOT. Despite attempts at contacting Andrew, these changes never made it through.

###A Period of Silence
After these events, JA departed, on the 22nd of April. To mark his departure, many YWOT worlds changed the colors to their pages, to match the color schemes on JA's page. Shortly thereafter, other members like AtLeastK left the site, leading to a long period of inactivity. Eventually in the coming months there would be an update of the site's URL system and a move from /Comprehensive to the new world ~index.
