After the take over of Vsauce viewers, spam on YWOT became a real problem. Because scripts and members were readily available, a "spam mafia" originated on YWOT. One of these such spamming groups was Mothereffers.

Little is known about Mothereffers because their page has been made private [/Mothereffers](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/mothereffers).

In addition the influence of the art and culture of YWOT grew, probably the fastest in all its history. A notable monument was the YWOT "Ladder to Heaven", as well as the ascii city located near west of the center area which was in the end destroyed by newcomers to the site.

Important events include:

- The Lockdown of Christmas 2012
- Deathcloud
- Departure of BlackInk
- Departure of JA
- The No Owner-Box Period
- The Make it Member Campaigns
- Paradise and Nirvahna

###Era of Spam
Spam was constant by this era on YWOT, and the amount would only increase as time passed. As scripts became more widespread whether through distribution or from creation, spamming groups formed which often spammed ywot pages by request. [Deathcloud](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/deathcloud) was a notable one that then became the target of spam because of the wide range of its attacks.

Though organizations became involved in spamming, so did many individuals. Users included Yen, BlackInk, and Whitemouse, who eventually formed alliances, complicating the playing field. YWOT eventually became divided into two sides, people who spammed and then opposers to the spam. It wasn't until late January that the tensions finally eased. Much of the impact of the spam wars became hidden in the background. Spam, however, would continue to impact YWOT for a very long time. Indeed the spam wars were a period of intense scripted warfare.

###Era of Change
December 21st marked the first Lockdown of the frontpage. Following large quantities of spam Andrew responded by removing nearly all public area on the frontpage. The reaction was of course largely negative. As the lockdown occured on the rumored date of the Mayan apocalypse it was given the name the [Apocalypse](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/11_12_13)/Rapture. In addition it was giving the name the holiday lockdown because of its occurence near the holidays.

The lockdown was ended on the 23rd of December.

###Support Grows for A Member-Only YWOT


Following the events leading up to and after the lockdown, JA, an active member of YWOT and co-founder of Silent Nation Clan, expressed his support for a members-only front page. His main page he created was [/MAKEITMEMBER](http://yourworldoftext.com/makeitmember). BlackInk, a spammer from the spam wars, also expressed his support on his page [/BlackInkDeparture](http://yourworldoftext.com/BlackInkDeparture). Randomguy_ (Created ~YwotWiki) also joined JA's campaign, with his own (then Anon) page [/YwotForProgress](http://yourworldoftext.com/ywotforprogress). These protests mostly occured on the user level and never made it past to Andrew.

###JA Departs YWOT
After these events, JA departed, on the 22nd of April. To mark his departure, many YWOT worlds changed the colors to their pages, to match the color schemes on JA's page. Shortly thereafter, other members like AtLeastK left the site, leading to a long period of inactivity. Though the results of the spam war was seen as a stalemate, spam would continue to overtake the website, in all its forms. Eventually in the coming months there would be an update of the site's URL system and a move from /Comprehensive to the new world ~index.
