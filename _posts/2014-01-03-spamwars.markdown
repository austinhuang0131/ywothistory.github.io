The **spam wars** were started when spamming groups formed around the end of the Vsauce era. Lasting from August 11th, 2012 to July 8th 2013, this time period was marked by the attacks of spam groups on the frontpage (in particular Mothereffers), against various YWOT pages, and against each other.

In addition the influence of the art and culture of YWOT grew, probably the fastest in all its history. A notable monument was the YWOT "Ladder to Heaven", as well as the ASCII City located near west of the center area which was eventually destroyed.

Important events include:

- The Christmas 2012 Lockdown
- The Deathcould Spammings
- Departure of BlackInk
- Departure of JA
- The No Owner-Box Period
- Make it Member Campaigns
- Formation and Destruction of Paradise/Nirvana
- Founding of Comprehensive
- The January 2013 4chan Influx

###Era of Spam
Spam was constant on YWOT, and would become more common as time passed. If you will, a mafia-like culture overcame YWOT, with different groups fighting for dominance. Some included Mothereffers and [Deathcloud](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/deathcloud). Many individuals joined the skirmishes as well. People like Yen, BlackInk, and Whitemouse became involved in the fights. It wasn't until late January that the tension finally eased. Many of the pages were dissolved or erased. Any major impact of the spam wars faded away quickly. Spam, however, would continue to impact YWOT for a very long time.

###Era of Change
December 21st Marked the first shutdown of the YWOT frontpage. Following large quantities of spam Andrew responded by removing nearly all public area on the frontpage. The reaction was of course largely negative. As the lockdown occured on the rumored date of the Mayan apocalypse it was given the name the [Apocalypse](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/11_12_13)/Rapture. Also because it occurred close to the holidays it was called the Holiday Lockdown as well.

The lockdown was ended on the 23rd of December. The member-only periods then and later on March 22nd would provide a base for future movements that supported a member-only frontpage.

###Member-Only Reforms
Soon after the lockdown JA, an active member of YWOT and co-founder of Silent Nation Clan, expressed his support for a members-only front page. His main page he created was [/MAKEITMEMBER](http://yourworldoftext.com/makeitmember). BlackInk, a spammer from the spam wars, also expressed his support on his page [/BlackInkDeparture](http://yourworldoftext.com/BlackInkDeparture). A user named Randomguy_ (Created ~YwotWiki) also joined JA's campaign, anonymously in hopes of bettering YWOT. Despite attempts at contacting Andrew, these changes never made it through.

###A Period of Silence
After these events, JA departed, on the 22nd of April. To mark his departure, many YWOT worlds changed the colors to their pages, to match the color schemes on JA's page. Shortly thereafter, other members like AtLeastK left the site, leading to a long period of inactivity. Eventually in the coming months there would be an update of the site's URL system and a move from /Comprehensive to the new world ~index.
