Your World Of Text (YWOT) once had a beta stage! This era in YWOT history ran from August 4th, 2009, through September 23th, 2009. Most of the info from the beta era is saved from Andrew's trusty [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/yourworldoftext). 

###Life in Beta

The URL of the site was [beta.yourworldoftext.com](http://www.beta.yourworldoftext.com) until 9.23.09 on its official release, when it was changed to redirect to [yourworldoftext.com](http://www.yourworldoftext.com).

Beta was pretty simple for YourWorldOfText. The only availiable ability was page claiming. The full known list of worlds from this time are at ~index's [Beta Page](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~index/BETA) on YWOT. The users then are:

ohsin, dmmcintyre3, Danielj, Barber, Ofy1993, Sponge, ninjawars, HotShot, and Dantelia.

As far as I know none of these people are left today :(

###URL Naming

All worlds created during the beta era are found in `yourworldoftext.com/beta/[...]` For example:

- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~ohsin/Mario)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~dmmcintyre3/macbook)
- [yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm](http://yourworldoftext.com/beta/~sponge/wyrdysm)

Though only around 20 beta worlds are now known there may be many more (I'm currently e-mailing andrew). It's possible a full list could be put together in the future.
