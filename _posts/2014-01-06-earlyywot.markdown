From the time from September 23rd, 2009 to when all standard features of ywot rolled out in February 9th, 2010, the site gained momentum in its growth. Check out: [yourworldoftext.appspot.com](http://www.yourworldoftext.appspot.com).

Later, in the 2nd half of this era lasting from the same date to March 29th, 2011 when the Vsauce video came out, this era for YWOT was a sign of things to come.

Many people arrived here from 4chan, contributing to the site. One of the ways was through javascript.

Among the members of YWOT was [Fang](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~mcdowell/fang), his scripts could modify various elements of the site. It seems many scripts were in development by different people during this era, which would in the future possibly allow mass spamming...

Very early versions of pasting scripts exist, like the YWMS, or YourWorld Mass Sender. Able to paste and send large amounts of text, it is almost like script now, it may be even more powerful. Check it out on [/~Lynxy/YWMS](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~Lynxy/YWMS). DON'T DOWNLOAD IT; There is a chance it could track you.

The following era, the Vsauce Era, yielded an entirely new set of scripts and new ideas produced by the visitors from Vsauce. Many things would be as a result of the rapid growth in membership.
