After beta testing had finished, the site gained momentum in its growth.

Many people arrived here from 4chan, contributing to the site. One of the ways was through javascript.

Among the members of YWOT was [Fang](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~mcdowell/fang), his scripts could modify various elements of the site. It seems many scripts were in development by different people during this era, which would in the future possibly allow mass spamming...

The following era, the Vsauce Era, yielded an entirely new set of scripts and new ideas produced by the visitors from Vsauce. Many events would transpire as a result of this rapid growth in membership.
