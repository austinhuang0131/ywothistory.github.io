This time period is called the **Vsauce Era**, starting on the date of the Vsauce video's release and ending on August 11th, 2012 when a second DONGS video referencing YWOT was put out. After the video was released, membership took off. The Vsauce video, "[10 AMAZING Flash Games - DONG!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isEwaLUiLP4)" gained over 300,000 views during its first three months on YouTube. In addition, the video made "VSAUCE!!!!" a meme on YWOT. This era lasted from March 29th, 2011 to August 11th, 2012.
