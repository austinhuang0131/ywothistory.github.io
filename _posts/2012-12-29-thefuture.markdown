This concludes a summary of YWOT history. Not much more can be said although digging around on my sites or on YWOT may produce more information. What will come of YWOT is uncertain. Things will keep changing and reforming. As of November 5th 2014 I have left YWOT, this time intending never to return. I hope the future of YWOT will be a useful one, better than what I have experienced. With /~ywotwiki shut down and historyofywot tossed away, somebody may come to replace what has been trashed. Until then I guess you will leave this site not with a firm grip of history but an ambiguous one ending in a question mark?

Thank you for visiting this site.
