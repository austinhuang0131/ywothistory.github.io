###YWOT dives head first into a vague future

At this point in YWOT's long and winding history, events were piled behind it like dead bodies during the plague. Uncoincidentally, YWOT began to enter a Dark Age.

Many of the greatest achievements of YWOT fell down the drain, including pages such as ~Help, ~YwotWiki, ~index, and many others. The users behind these pages departed, leaving behind a mess of information that could not be fixed. Scripts were the only institution that remained unshaken, but in a twist of fate they were used, and honed, for spamming others.

The website fell into a sort of anarchy, deeper than the one it had already existed in. It was unsure whether the newest members of the community could create a legacy as lasting and powerful as the previous wave of YWOT users.

###~index is again updated

Randomguy_ returned briefly, working to bring the page ~index up to date. Its design was updated for a final time, and /worlds were removed from its roster, dropping the world count from near 2000 to 1300.

###The ~wow99 incident

A user by the name of ~wow99, an alternate alias of Lol007 spammed multiple pages on YWOT. His effects were minimal and quickly brushed off by the community.
