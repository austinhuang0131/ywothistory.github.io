title: The Deathcloud Spammings

Deathcloud was one of the more memorable spamming groups which existed during the Spam Wars, being at one point the most powerful one on the website, comparable to Mothereffers. They were a gang of spammers comprised of [The_Russian](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~The_Russian), [DemonicKings](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/DemonicKings), GingerPower, and one unknown member. They managed to get away with spamming various pages before the group dismantled. The_Russian continues to spam YWOT on his own to this day.

The Deathcloud Spammings occured during January 2013, when various pages and the front page were spammed by Deathcloud.

###The Beginnings of a Great Power

It is verifiable that Deathcloud was started by GingerPower, with no real motive to be found. The early history of the group is not known, as little was seen of them before the spammings.

Deathcloud spammed many pages. Most can be seen in their "Troll Log" visible in the picture. Their downfall would be marked with the spamming of [/SilentNationClan](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~Sedrys/SilentNationClan). [InfraRaven](http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~InfraRaven) became an ally of jony1299 (JA) and launched a counterattack against Deathcloud.

###The Spammer Gets Spammed

InfraRaven produced the page /DeathCloudFails, which is not around today. However, it was a page with a single 2x2 owner box in the middle with the "Fail Whale" logo in the center.

He repeatedly spammed "Fail Whales" onto Deathcloud's page. Chances are he directly contacted Andrew, because the owner of the page quickly left and heeded all responsibility to DemonicKings. For whatever reason, the spamming group broke apart and stopped spamming. The short "war" had resulted in a positive outcome for some.

###Impacts of the Feud

Although Deathcloud was a relatively short lived spamming gang, the impacts are widespread and still exist today.

DeathKingdom was created shortly thereafter, possibly as a successor to the somewhat successful Deathcloud. Both Deathcloud and DemonicKing's page were unclaimed, and can be viewed today.

The fight also produced memes such as the Trollface and the Fail Whale, though these are much forgotten by the newer members of YWOT. In total, the Deathcloud Spammings were a significant event that left its mark on YWOT for months to come.
