  <h2>What in god's name is this?</h2>
  <p>This, my dear fellow, is the History of YWOT, as chronicled by a multitude of people and personalities.<br />We hope you enjoy this very very very much. Or, at least, a little bit.</p>
	<h2>But... why?</h2>
	<p>After being a member of the site for a month, Randomguy_ wanted to make learning about YWOT and the history therof easier for everybody. To do this, he made /ywotwiki (now <a href="http://yourworldoftext.com/~ywotwiki">/~YwotWiki</a>), and also founded <a href="http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~randomguy_/historyofywot">/historyofywot</a>. These pages are an extention of Randomguy_'s "wiki" pages on YWOT.</p>
	<h2>How were the time periods divided?</h2>
	<p>They were mostly made around a year long, centered around a major event or occurence. Beta is self-explanatory. Early YWOT runs from the end of beta to when all features came out. Pre-Vsauce is just the time between that and the Vsauce Era, which began with Vsauce making YWOT famous. August 11th is just a random date, and spam wars runs until the update came out. This is the current era we're in.</p>
