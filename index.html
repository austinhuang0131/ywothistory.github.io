  <h2>What in god's name is this?</h2>
  <p>This, my dear fellow, is the History of YWOT, as chronicled by a multitude of people and personalities.<br />We hope you enjoy this very very very much. Or, at least, a little bit.</p>
	<h2>But... why?</h2>
	<p>After being a member of the site for a month, Randomguy_ wanted to make learning about YWOT and the history therof easier for everybody. To do this, he made /ywotwiki (now <a href="http://yourworldoftext.com/~ywotwiki">/~YwotWiki</a>), and also founded <a href="http://www.yourworldoftext.com/~randomguy_/historyofywot">/historyofywot</a>. These pages are an extention of Randomguy_'s "wiki" pages on YWOT.</p>
